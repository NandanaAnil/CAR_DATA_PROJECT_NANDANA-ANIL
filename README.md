Car Data Analysis and Price Prediction
This project analyzes a car dataset to gain insights into key attributes and predict selling prices using machine learning models. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and performance evaluation.

Key Highlights:

Detailed data cleaning and preprocessing

Visualization of trends like fuel type, seller type, and ownership patterns

Use of Linear Regression and other models for price prediction

Evaluation using metrics such as RÂ² score and MAE

This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques in the automotive domain to support data-driven pricing strategies.
